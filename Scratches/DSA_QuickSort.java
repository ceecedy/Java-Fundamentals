        // QUICK SORT
        /*
            * There's a "pivot" used in the quick sort algorithm. It tells where the loop will stop traversing. 
            * Pivot was typically setup in the very last element of the array. 
            * The goal of the quick sort is to make the pivot find its resting place. 
            * When pivot finds it resting place, the all left part of the pivot is taken and also is the right part. 
            * Left part and right part will have their own pivot - repeating the same process as the first process does. 
            
            * There should be two trackers traversing the array in the quick sort. If the leading tracker gets an element 
                and that element is "lessthan to the pivot element, then the following tracker will move to the next index".
                On the other hand, if the leading tracker gets an element which was "greater than or equal to the pivot 
                element, then the leading tracker will move to the next index." After one moving of either tracker happens, 
                they are bound to get swapped. After swapping, the leading tracker will automatically move to the next index,
                and see again if its less than or (greater or equal) to the pivot. 
            * After all above processes, if the "leading tracker" reaches the pivot index, the following tracker will move to
                the next index and the pivot which was the leading tracker now and the following tracker are about to get 
                swapped. And that's how you find the pivot's resting place. 
            * After finding the first pivot resting place, the all left part of the pivot will be treated as partition and 
                also the all right part. On the partitions, another choice of pivot and another traversal while swapping 
                going to happen. 
            
            * Quick sort is also a divide and conquer concept and it uses recursion.
