            - We can see that there's another method from enums that are used and that is the ordinal. Ordinal method

/*
    * ENUMERATION (ENUMS) MORE EXPLANATIONS *
    - Enums is a type of class that holds a group of values. It is a special type of declaration that looks an array. 
    - Enums value are related to each other values. Just look at the example above, we can see that the values are the 
        dates of week. So they are called enum Day. 
    - The values of enums are constants. 
    - The index counting of enum starts with '0'.
    - Enum is a class but this can't be extended to any classes. 
    - Enum declarations by default extends Enum.class.

    * ADVANCED ENUMS *
    - When declaring enums, all the values of it is an object. Meaning for every values of enum, it can have specific 
        literal values that they can possess. This is possible by giving them directly the value. It is possible by 
        declaring a private variable inside also the same enum. 
    - But in order for the objects or values in enum to have a actual values it has to have a constructor of the same enum 
        using the declared variable inside the enum as parameter. 
    - In order to have interchangable values in the objects of enums, we can use encapsulation or getters and setters 
        implementation inside the enum and use the declared variable as parameter. 
    - We can use multiple constructors inside the enums to support the other objects or values in the enums to have 
        no values. 
    - Once you set a value to one object in the enum, all values should have declared values also.
